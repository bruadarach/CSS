        Data journalism is "a way of enhancing reporting and news writing with the use and examination of statistics in order to
        provide a deeper insight into a news story and to highlight relevant data. One trend in the digital era of journalism
        has been to disseminate information to the public via interactive online content through data visualization tools such
        as tables, graphs, maps, infographics, microsites, and visual worlds. The in-depth examination of such data sets can
        lead to more concrete results and observations regarding timely topics of interest. In addition, data journalism may
        reveal hidden issues that seemingly were not a priority in the news coverage". 
        
        Data journalism is a type of
        journalism reflecting the increased role that numerical data is used in the production and distribution of information
        in the digital era. It reflects the increased interaction between content producers (journalist) and several other
        fields such as design, computer science and statistics. From the point of view of journalists, it represents "an
        overlapping set of competencies drawn from disparate fields".
        
        Data journalism has been widely used to unite several concepts and link them to journalism. Some see these as levels or
        stages leading from the simpler to the more complex uses of new technologies in the journalistic process.
