        <p id="font2">Front-end web development is the practice of converting data to a graphical interface, through the use of HTML, CSS, and
        JavaScript, so that users can view and interact with that data.</p>
        <p id="font3">Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML)
        Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) is the backbone of any website development process, without which a web page doesn't
        exist. Hypertext means that text has links, termed hyperlinks, embedded in it. When a user clicks on a word or a phrase
        that has a hyperlink, it will bring another web-page. A markup language indicates text can be turned into images,
        tables, links, and other representations. It is the HTML code that provides an overall framework of how the site will
        look. HTML was developed by Tim Berners-Lee. The latest version of HTML is called HTML5 and was published on October 28,
        2014 by the W3 recommendation. This version contains new and efficient ways of handling elements such as video and audio
        files.</p>
        <p id="font4">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) controls the presentation aspect of the site and allows your site to have its own unique
        look. It does this by maintaining style sheets which sit on top of other style rules and are triggered based on other
        inputs, such as device screen size and resolution.</p>
        <p id="font5">JavaScript is an event-based imperative programming language (as opposed to HTML's declarative language model) that is
        used to transform a static HTML page into a dynamic interface. JavaScript code can use the [Document Object Model]
        (DOM), provided by the HTML standard, to manipulate a web page in response to events, like user input.
        
        Using a technique called AJAX, JavaScript code can also actively retrieve content from the web (independent of the
        original HTML page retrieval), and also react to server-side events as well, adding a truly dynamic nature to the web
        page experience.</p>
