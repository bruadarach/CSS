    # Specificity :
        MDN defines Specificity as "The specificity is a weight 
        that is applied to a given CSS declaration 
        based on the count of each selector type."

        Specificity is how the browser decides 
        which rule applies if multiple rules have different selectors, 
        but could still apply to the same element. 
        It is basically a measure of how specific a selector's selection will be:

     # Inheritance : 
        Inheritance also needs to be understood in this context 
        — some CSS property values set on parent elements are inherited by their child elements, 
        and some aren't.

        An element selector is less specific 
        — it will select all elements of that type that appear on a page 
        — so will get a lower score.

        A class selector is more specific 
        — it will select only the elements on a page that have a specific class attribute value 
        — so will get a higher score.

            e.g) As the body has been set to have a color of blue 
                this is inherited through the descendants.

            e.g) We can change the color 
                by targetting the element with a selector, such as this span.

<!--
    e.g.) body and ul is overlapped, right?
    in this case, the closer/narrower element/tag order is applied specifically
    in other word, if you specifically pinpoint elements/tags, it is applied.
