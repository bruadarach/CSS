<!-- font-size
    ems : The size of an em value is dynamic. 
          When defining the font-size property, 
          an em is equal to the size of the font 
          that applies to the parent of the element in question.

          If you haven't set the font size anywhere on the page, 
          then it is the browser default, which is often 16px.

    <span></span> : <div> 와 <span> 태그는 영역을 설정할 때 사용합니다. 
                    웹 페이지에 레이아웃을 구성하고 싶을 때 없어서는 안 되는 태그입니다. 
                    그럼 두 태그의 차이는 무엇일까요? 두 가지가 있습니다. 
                    하나는 줄 바꿈 입니다. div 는 줄 바꿈이 되지만 span 태그는 옆으로 붙습니다. 
                    두 번째 차이는 영역을 지정하는 방식의 차이입니다. 
                    텍스트를 표현할 때 div 는 사각형 박스로 구역을 정하지만 span 은 문장 단위로 지정합니다.

        <p>John Winston Ono Lennon[nb 1] MBE <span>(born John Winston Lennon, 9 October 1940 – 8 December 1980)</span> was an English singer, songwriter and peace activist[2] who gained worldwide fame as the founder, co-lead vocalist, and rhythm guitarist of the Beatles. His songwriting partnership with Paul McCartney remains the most successful in history.[3] In 1969, he started the Plastic Ono Band with his second wife, Yoko Ono. After the Beatles disbanded in 1970, Lennon continued as a solo artist and as a collaborator of Ono's music.</p>
        <p>Born in Liverpool, Lennon became involved in the skiffle craze as a teenager. In 1957, he formed his first band, the Quarrymen, which evolved into the Beatles in 1960. He was initially the group's de facto leader, a role gradually rescinded to McCartney. Starting in 1967, Lennon's lyrics began to espouse a pacifist message, and some of his songs were soon adopted as anthems by the anti-war movement and the larger counterculture. From 1968 to 1972, he produced more than a dozen records with Ono, including a trilogy of avant-garde albums, his first solo LP John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band, and the international top 10 singles "Give Peace a Chance", "Instant Karma!", "Imagine" and "Happy Xmas (War Is Over)".</p>
